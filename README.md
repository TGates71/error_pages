# error_pages
For use with Sentora Control Panel. This module allows the user to edit and restore the Custom Error pages for each of their domains. NOTE: Error pages are added automatically if they are found in the _errorpages directory and if they are a valid error code, and saved in the proper format: [error_number].html
